<h1>Product-management-api</h1>

This project involves creating a simple RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on product data stored in a MongoDB database.

<h3>Key Components:<h3>

1. **Express Server:** An Express server is set up to handle incoming HTTP requests and define API routes.

2. **MongoDB Database:** MongoDB is used as the database to store product data. 

4. **CRUD Operations:** API endpoints are defined for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products. These endpoints allow users to interact with the product data stored in the database.

5. **Error Handling:** Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle potential errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to clients.

<h3>Project Structure:<h3>

- Server Configuration:The `app.js` file sets up the Express server, defines routes for API endpoints, and connects to the MongoDB database.

- Product Model:The `prodectModels.js` file contains the Mongoose schema definition for the Product model, enforcing data validation and structure.

<h3>Conclusion:<h3>

This project showcases the development of a simple yet functional RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a foundation for building more complex applications and demonstrates basic CRUD operations in a web API context.
